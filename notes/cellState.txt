- save actual cells in ONE place
- any other grouping of cells (copy, active, etc) should only have cell IDs that can fetch the ACTUAL cells
- cells need to be saved in an OBJECT. so can be looped through OR accessed directly

setting state functionally for cells

step 1:
retrieve copy of cell. needs:
-id
-row
-col
-input and input styles

step 2:
mutate this copy

step 3:
pass in mutated copy and overwrite cell in allCells array with the new values given from the copy

how to handle cells:

1. _state.allCells: {
    'r1c1': <cell with id r1c1>
}

2. _state.cutCopy.cells = [(array with ids)]
3. _state.activeCells = [(array with ids)]
