idea:

create a 'command mode' similar to vim that allows for certain controls:

1. active cell movement
a. move active cell to top of current col
b. move active cell to bottom of current col
c. move active cell to left of current row
d. move active cell to right of current row
e. left 1 cell, up 1 cell, right 1 cell, down 1 cell

2. page movement
a. page down, page all the way down
b. page up, page all the way up
c. page right, page all the way right
d. page left, page all the way left

3. row/col modifications
a. insert row
b. delete row
c. insert col
d. delete col




--- how to get into 'command mode'
    1. hit escape key (i to go back to normal)


--- what ex should be like
    1. (':' at bottom - 'insert' for insert mode)

--- need to somehow disable the keybinds for normal mode

-- maybe always check for 'state.mode' first. and have totally different flow
