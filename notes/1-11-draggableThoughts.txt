Right now I am adding/removing from active cells on drag events. This is not necessary. Instead, I should only update those arrays on mouseUp.

Relevant state fields:
- activeCells
- mousedown
- draggableDiv ?
- startCellRect ?
- end CellRect ?

flow:
*mousedown*
*mouseover*
*mouseup*
then re-assess.

So the event is 'mouseup'. But I only need to do this if _state.drag is true. After doing this, _state.drag can be false.

to trigger _state.drag... set it once I get to handle drag if not already true.

-------------
after benchmarking this was actually 10x slower. Reason being that checking the cell's color (to determine if a previously active cell needed to be turned white) seems to be taking much longer than checking 'cell.active'. and 'cell.active' is only updated on state changes.


another idea is to stop ever looping through all cells. this seems like a must. find a way to only loop through a specific subset.
