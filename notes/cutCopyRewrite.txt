new flow:

1. (cut/copy button clicked)

- ignore if no active cells

* if active cells, create cell array containing those cell IDs and save to _state.cutCopy.cells. this should be an ARRAY of ARRAYS: each ROW is an array. This means that the # of inner arrays is equal to the ROW COUNT and the length of these inner array will ALWAYS be the same and is the COL count
* _state.cutCopy.type = either cut/paste

2. (paste button clicked)

a. find and save space of first 'active' element. If multiple cells are active find the top-left which is lowest row, lowest column

b. check the 'cutCopy array' for the first element in the first array. then find the corresponding cell in ALLCELLS.

c. use a 'copy cell' function that will retrieve the values from the copied cell, and paste them into this first new ACTIVE cell.

d. move along the first 'cutCopy array' until either reaching the end, or reaching a point where there exists no cell in ALLCELLS. at this point, skip to next array and repeat process from steps b-c

e. if type was 'cut' then call 'clear cells' on entire cutcopy cell array. then reassign this to copy - while a hack this will make the future 


**** problem:
if original value changes we lose input. therefor 'copyArray' SHOULD contain copies of the cells

NOTHING SHOULD BE SORTED. THE CELLS SHOULD BE PLACED INTO ARRAY IN ORDER TO BEGIN WITH.
