right now things are looped together with elements, listeners, handlers, etc, by 'category'

but categories doesnt make much sense as everything is connected anyway. might make more sense to group by type:


eventListeners
-eventListeners.js (all listeners)
|
v
v

eventHandlers
index.js (master router)
paste.js
cssBuotton.js
common.js
etc

(one file for each *event*)
- this serves to help make it clear what the events are



*all events still need to go through a specific 'listener'* this is needed in case of 'input' as the 'event' may not be triggered by the user but instead as a result of a different event.


event listener ->> router ->> trigger ->> handler

*or* ....... trigger ->> handler (in case of event such as input)

- cell (folder)
- toolbar (folder)
- listener.js
- router.js
- preHandler.js
- handlers (folder)
- common.js
- state.js
