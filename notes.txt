## Handling copy/paste

desired functionality:
1. copy multiple cells
2. select new cell
3. paste in copied cells in same format as had been copied

Idea:
- could have _state.copied, which is an array (default []) of the copied cells. When pasting, paste the exact new cells.


Issues:
 - need to be mindful of cell Ids and input Ids
 - knowing the shape of the cells


 New idea:
 - find row, col square of selection


Question: 
 Do Id's need to persist? Or is it ok for them to change.
