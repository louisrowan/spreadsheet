plan out selecting cells with shift.


1. keep track of 'shift active' in state - this is on keydown when key = 'shift'
- state
- event listener
- router
- prehandler
- handler

2. new event for 'handle shift active' on keydown - intercept events before regular keydown events fire
* order vs command active? at this point I won't worry about order*
- event listener
- router
- prehandler
- handler... same drag one?
